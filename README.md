### Hi there 👋

I work as Front-end Developer at King in Stockholm. Apart from Front-end, I also normally craft with Python and cloud technologies and sometimes I automate stuff that can be easily done manually 😅. 

I have large experience leading medium-size and large-size tech teams and had have the chance to work on different kinds of projects that go from marketing websites to fully functional applications.

Recently I took the Documentation Advocating craft in my team after reading the book "Docs for Developers", so now I'm working on developing my tech writing skills, so be Kind and write the docs! 📘
